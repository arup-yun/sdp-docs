# How to call libraries hosted on ArupCompute from TDA

[ArupCompute](https://compute.arup.digital/) hosts a number of Engineering and Design libraries in a scalable cloud environment for other projects to use.  Libraries such as [DesignCheck](https://arup.sharepoint.com/teams/global-design-automation-team/SitePages/DesignCheck.aspx) include a large amount of verified engineering functions and logic that can be re-used.

Libraries (and the functions contained within them) can be called directly from the TDA App API using standard Web API calls.

## Examples
See the 'midas_submit' app in the TDA Apps API repository.
