# Introduction to Arup Workflow Framework development for TDA platform

[Arup Workflow Framework](https://awf.arup.com/) hosts a number of workflows which automate a series of activities for an engineering process.  An AWF workflow may be viewed as equivalent to an 'app' on the TDA platform, as an AWF workflow (currently) collects input and then automates tasks before providing output without any further user intervantion.  

How to develop an AWF workflow is beyond the scope of this document.  Please see the [AWF Developer Docs](https://awf.arup.com/#/docs)
