# Developing Apps for the TDA Platform

## Architecture of a typical TDA App.

A typical app on the TDA platform is broken down into 3 specific areas:
- User interface (frontend).  See [App User Interface development](/app_dev/ui/intro)
- API (backend) See [App API development](/app_dev/api/intro)
- Core Engineering/Design logic.  This may be implemented in a number of ways
    - In a Grasshopper script.  See [App GH development](/app_dev/gh/intro)
    - In ArupCompute (incl. DesignCheck):  See: [Calling ArupCompute](/app_dev/api/calling-arupcompute)
    - In an Arup Workflow Framework workflow.  See [App AWF development](/app_dev/awf/intro)
    - Directly within the App API (if it's simple logic)
