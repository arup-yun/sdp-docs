## Session


<!-- ### Object

The basic unit of information in Speckle is an **object**, not a file.

### Stream 

Speckle stores collections of objects in **streams**. You can think of it as similar a file, or a ISO 19650 information container.

### Version

The name stream invokes the idea of flow, and Speckle is built from the ground up to accomodate flowing data. Each time a Speckle plugin sends data to the server, it creates a new **version** of the data. (These were originally called __clones__. If you ever see that term in the user interface, it means the same thing as a version.)

### Project

Speckle streams must be stored in a **project**. A project is useful for storing 

## Installing the plugins

You can install most of the Speckle plugins with a single installer. It is available either in [ArupApps](http://gloarupapps01/Shopping/requestItem/detail?id=2498) or from [GitHub](https://github.com/arup-group/SpeckleInstaller/releases/latest). New versions of the clients are released first to GitHub, then to ArupApps a few days later.

After running this installer, you will have Speckle plugins for the following software:

* [Revit](/plugins/revit.html)
* [Rhino](/plugins/rhino.html)
* [GSA](/plugins/gsa.html)
* [Grasshopper](/scripting/grasshopper.html)
* [Dynamo](/scripting/dynamo.html)

A few other plugins have a different installation method. Check out their documentation for more details

* [Excel](/plugins/excel.html)
* [Blender](/plugins/blender.html)
* [Python](/scripting/python.html)
