# Speckle in Python

There is a python speckle module maintained by [Tom Svilans](https://github.com/tsvilans). It can be installed with the command `pip install speckle`.

Documentation is available at [https://pyspeckle.readthedocs.io/](https://pyspeckle.readthedocs.io/).

When using the python speckle module, you will need to the use [login_with_token](https://pyspeckle.readthedocs.io/en/v2.3.0/quickstart.html#registering-and-logging-in) method for connecting to the [Arup servers](http://localhost:8080/getting-started.html#arup-s-speckle-servers), since they are integrated with our Arup accounts, and do not support raw username and email login.
