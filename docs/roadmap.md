# The TDA Platform Development Roadmap

Content TBC  (or link to the roadmap elsewhere)

<!-- Starting in the 2021 fiscal year, Arup's high-level Speckle Roadmap will be agreed between the Speckle development team and the Speckle steering committee. The steering committee will be made up of each region's Automation leaders and a representative from each of Speckle's target markets' Global skills networks.

This page will be updated every three months with the top developement priorities of the team.

## February 2021

As of the end of February, 2021, the following areas are under development, with the (optimistic?) aim to be shipped by the end of March:

* a new Speckle documentation site (you're looking at it!!), including:
  * Use cases for structural, building services and linear infrastructure applications
  * Information about Speckle for project leaders, BIM coordinators and designers
* Microstation, OpenRoads and OpenRail clients - alpha for early testing
* Civil3D client - alpha for early testing
* Speckle Grasshopper Rhino.Compute compatible sender and receiver components
* SpeckleGSA user interface review and improvements
* Speeding up the extraction and uploading of results from GSA (finally..!)
* Migration of all CI/CD pipelines and UI elements from SpeckleWorks repositories to Arup repositories
* Implementation analytics gathering across the servers and clients
* Mandatory project numbers for new streams
* bug fixes!!!
